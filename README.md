# Train-Evaluate-Machine-Learning-Classifiers
Create, train and evaluate various machine learning classifiers on a dataset.

This machine learning project aims to build and evaluate various classification models using a supervised dataset. The dataset consists of labeled data points, where each data point contains a set of features and a corresponding class label. The goal of the project is to train machine learning classifiers that can accurately predict the class labels of new data points.

Before building the classifiers, data preprocessing is performed to clean and transform the raw data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. The preprocessing step includes tasks such as data cleaning, missing value imputation, feature scaling, and feature selection. This step is crucial as it helps to ensure that the classifiers receive high-quality input data, which can improve their performance.

After data preprocessing, various machine learning classifiers are trained on the dataset. The project uses popular classifiers. The performance of each classifier is evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation is used to estimate the generalization performance of the classifiers.

To improve the performance of the classifiers, hyperparameter tuning is performed using grid search. Hyperparameters are parameters of the machine learning models that cannot be learned from the data and must be set manually. Tuning the hyperparameters can significantly improve the performance of the classifiers.

Finally, the best-performing classifier is selected based on its performance on the evaluation metrics. The performance of the selected classifier is further tested on a hold-out test set, which was not used during the model training or hyperparameter tuning.
